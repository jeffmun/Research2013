            This is mostly used for checkbox fields because during data exports and data imports, checkbox fields have a different variable name used than the exact one defined for them in the Online Designer and Data Dictionary, in which *each checkbox option* gets represented as its own export field name in the following format: field_name + triple underscore + converted coded value for the choice. 
            For non-checkbox fields, the export field name will be exactly the same as the original field name. 
            Note: The following field types will be automatically removed from the list returned by this method since they cannot be utilized during the data import process: 'calc', 'file', and 'descriptive'.
            
            The list that is returned will contain the three following attributes for each field/choice: 'original_field_name', 'choice_value', and 'export_field_name'. 
            The choice_value attribute represents the raw coded value for a checkbox choice.For non-checkbox fields, the choice_value attribute will always be blank/empty.

            Create A New Project
            
            This method allows you to create a new REDCap project. A 64-character Super API Token is required for this method (as opposed to project-level API methods that require a regular 32-character token associated with the project-user). In the API request, you must minimally provide the project attributes 'project_title' and 'purpose' (with numerical value 0=Practice/Just for fun, 1=Other, 2=Research, 3=Quality Improvement, 4=Operational Support) when creating a project. 
            When a project is created with this method, the project will automatically be given all the project-level defaults just as if you created a new empty project via the web user interface, such as a automatically creating a single data collection instrument seeded with a single Record ID field and Form Status field, as well as (for longitudinal projects) one arm with one event. And if you intend to create your own arms or events immediately after creating the project, it is recommended that you utilize the override=1 parameter in the 'Import Arms' or 'Import Events' method, respectively, so that the default arm and event are removed when you add your own.Also, the user creating the project will automatically be added to the project as a user with full user privileges and a project-level API token, which could then be used for subsequent project-level API requests.
            NOTE: Only users with Super API Tokens can utilize this method.Users can only be granted a super token by a REDCap administrator(using the API Tokens page in the REDCap Control Center). Please be advised that users with a Super API Token can create new REDCap projects via the API without any approval needed by a REDCap administrator.If you are interested in obtaining a super token, please contact your local REDCap administrator.

            The entire project(all records, events, arms, instruments, fields, and project attributes) can be downloaded as a single XML file, which is in CDISC ODM format(ODM version 1.3.1). This XML file can be used to create a clone of the project(including its data, optionally) on this REDCap server or on another REDCap server (it can be uploaded on the Create New Project page). Because it is in CDISC ODM format, it can also be used to import the project into another ODM-compatible system. NOTE: All the option paramters listed below ONLY apply to data returned if the 'returnMetadataOnly' parameter is set to FALSE (default). For this API method, ALL metadata (all fields, forms, events, and arms) will always be exported.Only the data returned can be filtered using the optional parameters.
            Note about export rights: If the 'returnMetadataOnly' parameter is set to FALSE, then please be aware that Data Export user rights will be applied to any data returned from this API request. For example, if you have 'De-Identified' or 'Remove all tagged Identifier fields' data export rights, then some data fields *might* be removed and filtered out of the data set returned from the API. To make sure that no data is unnecessarily filtered out of your API request, you should have 'Full Data Set' export rights in the project.

            Export Entire Project as REDCap XML File (containing metadata and data)
            The entire project(all records, events, arms, instruments, fields, and project attributes) can be downloaded as a single XML file, which is in CDISC ODM format(ODM version 1.3.1). This XML file can be used to create a clone of the project(including its data, optionally) on this REDCap server or on another REDCap server (it can be uploaded on the Create New Project page). Because it is in CDISC ODM format, it can also be used to import the project into another ODM-compatible system. NOTE: All the option paramters listed below ONLY apply to data returned if the 'returnMetadataOnly' parameter is set to FALSE (default). For this API method, ALL metadata (all fields, forms, events, and arms) will always be exported.Only the data returned can be filtered using the optional parameters.
            Note about export rights: If the 'returnMetadataOnly' parameter is set to FALSE, then please be aware that Data Export user rights will be applied to any data returned from this API request. For example, if you have 'De-Identified' or 'Remove all tagged Identifier fields' data export rights, then some data fields *might* be removed and filtered out of the data set returned from the API. To make sure that no data is unnecessarily filtered out of your API request, you should have 'Full Data Set' export rights in the project.

If you do not pass in this flag, it will default to 'false'. If set to 'true', it will return the redcap_survey_identifier field and also the survey timestamp field for a particular survey when at least one field from that survey is being exported. NOTE: If the survey identifier field or survey timestamp fields are imported via API data import, they will simply be ignored since they are not real fields in the project but rather are pseudo-fields.</param>

            <param name="exportFiles">true, false [default] - TRUE will cause the XML returned to include all files uploaded for File Upload and Signature fields for all records in the project, whereas FALSE will cause all such fields not to be included. NOTE: Setting this option to TRUE can make the export very large and may prevent it from completing if the project contains many files or very large files. </param>

            Generate Next Record Name
            To be used by projects with record auto-numbering enabled, this method exports the next potential record ID for a project. It generates the next record name by determining the current maximum numerical record ID and then incrementing it by one.
            Note: This method does not create a new record, but merely determines what the next record name would be.
            If using Data Access Groups (DAGs) in the project, this method accounts for the special formatting of the record name for users in DAGs (e.g., DAG-ID); in this case, it only assigns the next value for ID for all numbers inside a DAG. For example, if a DAG has a corresponding DAG number of 223 wherein records 223-1 and 223-2 already exist, then the next record will be 223-3 if the API user belongs to the DAG that has DAG number 223. (The DAG number is auto-assigned by REDCap for each DAG when the DAG is first created.) When generating a new record name in a DAG, the method considers all records in the entire project when determining the maximum record ID, including those that might have been originally created in that DAG but then later reassigned to another DAG.
            Note: This method functions the same even for projects that do not have record auto-numbering enabled.

            Import Users
            This method allows you to import new users into a project while setting their user privileges, or update the privileges of existing users in the project. 
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            To use this method, you must have API Import/Update privileges *and* User Rights privileges in the project.

            <param name="token">The API token specific to your REDCap project and username (each token is unique to each user for each project). See the section on the left-hand menu for obtaining a token for a given project.</param>

            <param name="data">
            Contains the attributes of the user to be added to the project or whose privileges in the project are being updated, in which they are provided in the specified format. All values should be numerical with the exception of username, expiration, data_access_group, and forms. Please note that the 'forms' attribute is the only attribute that contains sub-elements (one for each data collection instrument), in which each form will have its own Form Rights value (see the key below to learn what each numerical value represents). Most user privilege attributes are boolean (0=No Access, 1=Access). Please notice the distinction between data_access_group (contains the unique DAG name for a user) and data_access_groups (denotes whether the user has access to the Data Access Groups page).
            Missing attributes: If a user is being added to a project in the API request, then any attributes not provided for a user in the request(including form-level rights) will automatically be given the minimum privileges(typically 0=No Access) for the attribute/privilege.However, if an existing user's privileges are being modified in the API request, then any attributes not provided will not be modified from their current value but only the attributes provided in the request will be modified.
            Data Export: 0=No Access, 2=De-Identified, 1=Full Data Set
            Form Rights: 0=No Access, 2=Read Only, 1=View records/responses and edit records(survey responses are read-only), 3=Edit survey responses

            The REDCap API is an interface that allows external applications 
            to connect to REDCap remotely, and is used for programmatically 
            retrieving or modifying data or settings within REDCap, such as performing 
            automated data imports/exports for a specified REDCap project. 
            Programmers can use the REDCap API to make applications, websites, apps, widgets, 
            and other projects that interact with REDCap. Programs talk to the REDCap API 
            over HTTP, the same protocol that your browser uses to visit and interact with web pages.

Please note that the only way to update an existing Event is to provide the unique_event_name attribute, and if the unique_event_name attribute is missing for an Event being imported (when override=0), it will assume it to be a new Event that should be created.

            Import Events
            This method allows you to import Events into a project or to update existing Events' attributes, such as the event name, days offset, etc. The unique event name of an Event cannot be changed because it is auto-generated by REDCap. Please note that the only way to update an existing Event is to provide the unique_event_name attribute, and if the unique_event_name attribute is missing for an Event being imported (when override=0), it will assume it to be a new Event that should be created. Notice: Because of the 'override' parameter's destructive nature, this method may only use override=1 for projects in Development status.

            Create A New Project
            
            This method allows you to create a new REDCap project. A 64-character Super API Token is required for this method (as opposed to project-level API methods that require a regular 32-character token associated with the project-user). In the API request, you must minimally provide the project attributes 'project_title' and 'purpose' (with numerical value 0=Practice/Just for fun, 1=Other, 2=Research, 3=Quality Improvement, 4=Operational Support) when creating a project. 
            When a project is created with this method, the project will automatically be given all the project-level defaults just as if you created a new empty project via the web user interface, such as a automatically creating a single data collection instrument seeded with a single Record ID field and Form Status field, as well as (for longitudinal projects) one arm with one event. And if you intend to create your own arms or events immediately after creating the project, it is recommended that you utilize the override=1 parameter in the 'Import Arms' or 'Import Events' method, respectively, so that the default arm and event are removed when you add your own.Also, the user creating the project will automatically be added to the project as a user with full user privileges and a project-level API token, which could then be used for subsequent project-level API requests.
            NOTE: Only users with Super API Tokens can utilize this method.Users can only be granted a super token by a REDCap administrator(using the API Tokens page in the REDCap Control Center). Please be advised that users with a Super API Token can create new REDCap projects via the API without any approval needed by a REDCap administrator.If you are interested in obtaining a super token, please contact your local REDCap administrator.

            Generate Next Record Name
            To be used by projects with record auto-numbering enabled, this method exports the next potential record ID for a project. It generates the next record name by determining the current maximum numerical record ID and then incrementing it by one.
            Note: This method does not create a new record, but merely determines what the next record name would be.
            If using Data Access Groups (DAGs) in the project, this method accounts for the special formatting of the record name for users in DAGs (e.g., DAG-ID); in this case, it only assigns the next value for ID for all numbers inside a DAG. For example, if a DAG has a corresponding DAG number of 223 wherein records 223-1 and 223-2 already exist, then the next record will be 223-3 if the API user belongs to the DAG that has DAG number 223. (The DAG number is auto-assigned by REDCap for each DAG when the DAG is first created.) When generating a new record name in a DAG, the method considers all records in the entire project when determining the maximum record ID, including those that might have been originally created in that DAG but then later reassigned to another DAG.
            Note: This method functions the same even for projects that do not have record auto-numbering enabled.

'invitation_send_time' is the date/time in which the next invitation will be sent, and is blank if there is no invitation that is scheduled to be sent. 'response_status' represents whether the participant has responded to the survey, in which its value is 0, 1, or 2 for 'No response', 'Partial', or 'Completed', respectively. Note: If an incorrect event_id or instrument name is used or if the instrument has not been enabled as a survey, then an error will be returned.</returns>
