<h2>General Document Features</h2>

<h3>General Documents</h3>
<p>
	The Autism Center Intranet Site provides that ability to store documents of several types
	which can be easily accessed from various locations on the web site. These documents are
	added to the web server in various ways, but most generally they are uploaded from the
	Documents section of the intranet site (see the section below on <a href="#ULDocs">Uploading
	Documents</a> for more information). Documents on the web site can fall into one of the
	following categories:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Consent Form Version</li>
	<li>Data Form/Var Map</li>
	<li>Admin Protocol</li>
	<li>Behavior Summary</li>
	<li>Misc Subject Document</li>
	<li>Coding Manual</li>
	<li>Reliability Info</li>
	<li>Study Flow</li>
	<li>Misc Measure Doc</li>
	<li>Data Entry Instructions</li>
	<li>Manual of Operations</li>
</ul>
<a name="DocDBEntity" />
<h3>Documents for DB Entities</h3>
<p>
	There are several entities in the Autism Center Database that have related documents. The
	following list includes all of the types of entities for which we currently allow documents
	to exist on the web site:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Measures</li>
	<li>Study Measures</li>
	<li>Consent Forms (Versions)</li>
	<li>Subjects</li>
	<li>Households</li>
	<li>Studies</li>
	<li>Staff</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Some examples of documents include Measure Variable Maps; Subject Behavior Summaries; Study MOPs;
	Data Entry Instructions; Consent Forms; etc. It is not required that document that is uploaded to
	the web server needs to be related to one of the entities listed above; however, some documents
	would make little sense outside the context of a relationship to an entity. For example, a
	Subject Behavior Summary is not useful unless we know the subject to whom it belongs.

<h3>Downloading Documents</h3>
<p>
	In various places around the Autism Center Intranet Site, you will find links to these documents.
	For a complete list of documents on the web server, there is a report in the
	<a href="/Reports/" target="_new">Reports</a> section of the web site, under the Documents
	Reports category. While a page that allows staff members to search for a document does not
	currently exist on the intranet site at this time, there is a plan to build this in the future.
</p>

<h3>Uploading Documents</h3>
<p>
	All members of the Autism Research Group and IT Staff Group have permission to view the
	<a href="/Documents/UploadDocument.aspx">Upload Document Page</a>, and thus upload any document
	to the web server.<br/><br/>

	<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">It is advised that you upload any document
	with extreme caution, as you are likely to overwrite an existing document.</span>
</p>
<h4>Uploading New Documents</h4>
<p>
	Even though you think you may be uploading a new document, it is very important to make sure that
	this document does not already exist on the web server before uploading. You can check this by
	referencing the
	<a href="/Reports/ViewReport.aspx?hidReportID=9597bc60-fa7c-4d4a-a6a7-f75c7e7938f4" target="_new">Complete Document List Report</a>
	in the reports section of the web site. Once you have confirmed that this document does not already
	exist, you can continue with the upload. If you find that the document indeed does exist check
	with the person who uploaded the document. If you need to edit this document and replace the
	existing one, see the next section below.
</p>
<h4>Editing Existing Documents</h4>
<p>
	Sometimes it is necessary to edit a document that already exists on the web server. In order to
	do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure the changes you want to make are acceptble.</li>
	<li>Download the existing document to your PC (reference the <a href="/Reports/ViewReport.aspx?hidReportID=9597bc60-fa7c-4d4a-a6a7-f75c7e7938f4" target="_new">Complete Document List Report</a>)</li>
	<li>Open the file you just saved, make your edits to it.</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;Browse&quot; button on the Upload Document page and select the file you just edited.</li>
	<li>Fill out the rest of the Upload Document form.</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;Upload&quot; button.</li>
</ol>
