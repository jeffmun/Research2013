<h1>Recording Notes and Comments</h1>
<h2>Notes in General</h2>
<p>
	There are several locations on the Autism Center Intranet where written notes can be added.
	Because the tracking database involves so much information, it can be confusing figuring out
	where to put specific information.
</p>
<p>
	The first issue is to determine what the information describes. In general, we want the notes
	tied to the smallest unit to which it applies. For example, if you have a comment to write
	concerning a particular measure administered to a particular subject, you want to place the
	note with that subject's measure information rather than place it with the notes about the
	family as a whole.
</p>
<p>
	The following describes the variety of places where notes can be placed. They are listed from
	the most specific (or smallest unit) up to the most general.
</p>
<h2>Measures (&quot;the data&quot;)</h2>
<p>
	Any comments related to the administration of a specific measure to a particular subject should
	be placed in the Notes box on the Measure Status form. You can navigate to this form from a
	variety of places on the web site.
</p>
<h2>Actions (&quot;steps we take to get the data&quot;)</h2>
<p>
	Sometimes the information applies to a particular study action, such as receiving a questionnaire
	packet. Although there may be several measures in the packet, if you have comments about the
	packet as a whole and whether or not we've received it, etc., this should be placed in the
	Notes box on the Action Status form. You can navigate to this form from a variety of places on
	the web site.
</p>
<h2>Subjects</h2>
<p>
	Notes concerning a subject's current level of participation. The Notes section here should be
	thought of as providing additional information that further describes the subject's
	&quot;status&quot; and &quot;statusdetail&quot;.
</p>
<!--
<h2>Persons</h2>
<p>
	At times you may want to add notes to a person before he/she may be assigned as a subject. In
	these cases you could place notes in the Notes box on the Person section of the Household Info
	form.
</p>
<h2>Households</h2>
<p>
	There are a variety of places on the Household form where notes can be placed.
</p>
<p>
	First, the <b>General Information Log</b>. To view this log click the button indicated below.
</p>
<p>
	This log serves as a running list of miscellaneous notes/comments pertaining to the family.
	The notes listed here <span class="error">MUST</span> be categorized using the available
	drop-down control. The available categories include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Scheduling Needs</li>
	<li>Family Request</li>
	<li>Family Information</li>
	<li>Child Information</li>
	<li>Staff Comment</li>
	<li>Misc</li>
</ul>
<p>
	We can add additional options to this list as the need arises.
</p>
<p>
	The <b>priority</b> level of the note should also be indicated as either High or Low.
</p>
<p>
	As you can see the View Logs button also displays the <b>Contacts Log</b>. This log is for
	documenting the contacts made with a family. The info tracked here is only that related to
	the contact itself (a phone call made, letter sent, messgae left, etc.) and NOT any substantive
	information collected during the contact. For instance if you call to follow-up on a missing
	piece of data and learn that there has been an emergency with the family, place this in the
	General Info Log rather than in the Contacts Log.
</p>
<p>
	The rule of thumb is that you should note any contact made with a family that is outside of what
	typically occurs during the course of the study, so there is no need to log reminder calls and
	predefined study actions. For example, if a family is to receive a phone call for data
	collection and the call is completed normally, all the necessary information is documented as
	part of the study Action for that subject (i.e., the phone call). Thus, there is no need to
	duplicate this info by adding it to the Contacts Log. If, however, the phone call was missed
	for some reason (which could be documented in the &quot;status&quot; for the action) and a
	second attempt was made to reach the family to complete the call, this second attempt should be
	logged in the Contacts Log. This allows all study personnel to be aware of what additional
	interaction we have had with the family beyond what may be indicated in the list of study
	Actions.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, there are Notes fields for each of the following items:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>phone number</li>
	<li>email address</li>
	<li>mailing address</li>
	<li>contact person</li>
</ul>
<p>
	These should include only information directly relevant to the item. Place more broad information
	in the General Information Log.

	Obviously, the decision about where to place notes and the level of detail to report is not
	always clear. Use your best judgment and be clear.
