<h2>Measure Summaries</h2>
<p>
	In the &quot;Measure Summaries&quot; section, you can download a list of all of the Measures for
	all of the Subjects in a given study in a MS Excel format. Select the study you wish to view and
	click the &quot;Submit&quot; button. You will be prompted to open or save the Excel file. This
	process is very resource intensive and may take more than a minute to run. Please be patient.
</p>
<h2>Searching Features</h2>
<p>
	There are two ways to get to the &quot;Measures/Actions&quot; section of the site. First, you can click the
	&quot;Measures/Actions&quot; menu item on the left navigation. Entering this way, you are presented with a
	simple form by which you can search for Actions or Measures. As well, you can enter by clicking
	a link on one of the reports in the <a href="<% =Request.ApplicationPath %>/help/ReportsHelp.aspx">&quot;Reports&quot;</a> section of the site.
</p>
<p>
	There are two search types: simple and advanced. When you click the &quot;Measures/Actions&quot; link on the
	left navigation you are presented with the simple search form. A sub-menu item of &quot;Advanced
	Search&quot; appears under the &quot;Measures/Actions&quot; menu item. Clicking this link will take you to the
	advanced search page.

	drop-down list, the &quot;Actions&quot; drop-down list is populated with all of the Actions for the
	selected study. As well, there is a Subject ID text box on the form. In order to submit the
	simple search form, you must select a study and either a enter Subject ID into the text box or
	select an Action from the drop-down list. However, you can enter both a Subject ID and an Action.
</p>
<h4>Searching by Subject ID</h4>
<p>
	When you enter a Subject ID (but do not select an Action), a search is performed to make sure
	that the Subject ID is valid. If it is not valid, an error message is displayed. If it is valid,
	you will be presented with a list of all of the Actions for that Subject and Study. Included in
	this list are the following six columns:

<h2>Editing Features</h2>
<a name="EditingSubjects" />
<h3>Editing Subjects</h3>
<p>
	When you go to the &quot;Edit Subject&quot; page, you have the ability to change the Subject Status and
	Subject Status Detail as well as add or change the Notes for a given Subject. You are presented
	with two drop-down lists: one for Subject Status and one for Subject Status Detail. When you
	change the value of the Subject Status drop-down list, the Subject Status Detail drop-down is
	populated with the appropriate items for the selected Subject Status. To update these items,
	simply make your edits and click the &quot;Submit&quot; button.
</p>
<a name="EditingActions" />
<h3>Editing Actions</h3>
<p>
	When you go to the &quot;Edit Action&quot; page, you have the ability to change several of the items for a
	the Action as it applies to a Subject. On the page you will see three drop-down lists: one to
	select the Staff Member responsible for completing the Action, one to select the Staff Member who
	actually completed the Action, and one to set the Action Status for the Action. As well, there are
	three text boxes with calndar controls to select the date the Action was done, a starting due date,
	and an ending due date. There is also a large text area in which to enter notes about the Action as
	it applies to the Subject. To update any of these items, enter in the correct information and click
	the &quot;Save Changes&quot; button. Depending on the value selected in the &quot;Action Status&quot;
	drop-down list, the &quot;Comp. By&quot; and &quot;Date Done&quot; fields become required.
</p>
<p>
	Beneath the &quot;Edit Action&quot; form, there is also a list of all of the Measures that are to be
	collected in the Action along with their Measure Status, Date Collected, and the Clinician
	responsible for collecting them. Each item in the &quot;Measure&quot; column is a link to the &quot;Edit
	Measure&quot; page for that Measure. Items in this column that are flagged with an asterisk (*) have
	notes associated with them. To view the notes, move your mouse over the link and a tool-tip will
	appear. As well, there is a check box next to each Measure and two buttons beneath the list of
	Measures. Checking some of the Measures and clicking the &quot;Edit Checked Measures&quot; button
	will allow you to edit all of the Measures by applying the same value for the Measure Status, etc.
	to each Measure. Checking some of the Measures and clicking the &quot;Move Checked Measures to New
	Action&quot; button allows you to move the Measures to another Action. The Actions to which you are
	allowed to move the Measures are determined by the following rules:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If the CURRENT Action's status is NOT set to &quot;Canceled&quot;, the measures can be moved to
		any &quot;Session&quot;, &quot;Phone Call&quot;, or &quot;Receive Item&quot; action whose status
		is NOT set to &quot;Complete&quot;, &quot;Incompl/Need to FollowUp&quot;, &quot;Need to FollowUp&quot;,
		&quot;Canceled&quot;, and &quot;NA for Group&quot;.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the CURRENT Action's status IS set to &quot;Canceled&quot;, the measures can be moved to any
		&quot;Session&quot;, &quot;Phone Call&quot;, or &quot;Receive Item&quot; action whose status is
		NOT set to &quot;Canceled&quot;.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the Study that the Action is in is a &quot;Family Study&quot; (such as GEN or FEIN, where
		multiple members of the same household are subjects in the study), the same rules above apply,
		but you can also move the measures to another family member's actions which meet the above
		rules. However, it is STRONGLY recommended that you only do this when absolutely necessary, as
		it makes tracking much more challenging.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	For some Subjects, there is a link to the Subject's Behavior Summary that appears underneath these
	buttons. This link appears if a Behavior Summary exists for the subject. As well, if there are any
	Measures assigned to the Action, a list of the Measures will appear in a table underneath the
	Action form. Basic Measure information is displayed indicating the name of the Measure, it's
	status, the date it was collected, and the clinician who administered the Measure. There are links
	to the Edit Measure page (from the Measure column) and to the Data Entry Form (from the Data Entry
	column) if the form exists. There are two buttons that allow you to edit any combination of the
	Measures in the Action. The first button allows you to update the status, clinician, date done,
	and notes for the selected. The form to edit the Measures will open in a new window. The
	information you enter into this form will be applied to all of the Measures you selected. The
	second button allows you to move the selected Measures to a new Action. The Actions that you are
	allowed to move the Measures are determined by the following rules:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		If the CURRENT Action's status is NOT set to &quot;Canceled&quot;, the Measures can be moved to
		any &quot;Session&quot;, &quot;Phone Call&quot;, or &quot;Receive Item&quot; Action whose status
		is NOT set to &quot;Complete&quot;, &quot;Incompl/Need to FollowUp&quot;, &quot;Need to
		FollowUp&quot;, &quot;Canceled&quot;, and &quot;NA for Group&quot;.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the CURRENT Action's status IS set to &quot;Canceled&quot;, the Measures can be moved to any
		&quot;Session&quot;, &quot;Phone Call&quot;, or &quot;Receive Item&quot; action whose status is
		NOT set to &quot;Canceled&quot;.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the Study that the Action is in is a &quot;Family Study&quot; (such as GEN or FEIN, where
		multiple members of the same household are subjects in the study), the same rules above apply,
		but you can also move the measures to another family member's actions which meet the above
		rules. However, it is STRONGLY recommended that you only do this when absolutely necessary,
		as it makes tracking much more challenging.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	When you click the &quot;Save Changes&quot; button on the Edit Action form, the following takes place:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The Action's information is updated with the information entered in the form.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the Action is a Phone Call and the Status is &quot;Complete&quot; or &quot;Declined to
		Complete&quot;, an entry is made into the Household Contact Log.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the Action is the GEN Lab Visit and the Status is set to &quot;Complete&quot;,
		&quot;Canceled&quot;, &quot;NA for group&quot;, &quot;Scheduled&quot;, &quot;NA due to Subj
		Status&quot;, &quot;Tentative&quot;, or &quot;Declined to complete&quot; a flag is set to move
		them onto various GEN Reports. (These are basically the post-Sept. 2003 families).
	</li>
	<li>
		Any &quot;triggers&quot; that have been defined for the Action are executed. A trigger is
		piece of code that automatically change other actions' or measures' attributes based on the
		status of a &quot;triggering&quot; action.
	</li>
</ul>
<a name="SchedulingActions" />
<h3>Scheduling Actions</h3>
<p>
	The Schedule Action page allows you to set the date, start and end times, and location of an
	Action. You can also set the Assistant Status and add Assistant Notes (generally this should
	only be used when you're not sure who the Assistant(s) will be; if you know who the Assistant(s)
	will be, just add them to the action from the Edit Action page). When you submit this page, the
	Action Status for the Action is always set to &quot;Scheduled&quot;. There are several checks are done to
	make sure that there are no scheduling conflicts with Subjects, staff, rooms, dates, and times.
	The following things are checked:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The Subject you are scheduling does not have any conflicts. That is, if the Subject is also
		in another Study and has an appointment on the same date/time. (The Subject CAN be scheduled
		on the same date/time for different Actions in the SAME Study.)
	</li>
	<li>
		The Staff Member you are scheduling does not have any conflicts. That is, the staff member
		is not scheduled to be with two different Subjects at the same time. (The staff member CAN be
		scheduled on the same date/time for different Actions for the SAME Subject.) 
	</li>
	<li>
		The Location you are scheduling does not have any conflicts. That is, the location is not
		scheduled for different subjects at the same time. (The location CAN be scheduled on the
		same date/time for different Actions for the SAME subject.) There are certain locations where
		this rule does not apply such as, &quot;Home Visit&quot;, &quot;Out of Town&quot;,
		&quot;Phone&quot;, etc. The intranet only looks up other reservations in the tracking database;
		it is not integrated with the SOS scheduling utility. 
	</li>
	<li>
		If the Status of the Action that you are scheduling is set to &quot;Canceled&quot;, a NEW
		Action is created, copying all of the OLD action's information and scheduling it with the NEW
		information. The measures for the old action are then moved to the new action.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Given the fourth point above, the best way to cancel and reschedule an Action is to first set the
	Action's status to &quot;Canceled&quot;, then go to the Schedule Action page for this Action and change the
	date/time/etc. This will create the new, correctly scheduled Action.
</p>

<h3>Editing Measures</h3>
<p>
	When you go to the &quot;Edit Measure&quot; page, you have the ability to change several of the items for a
	the Measure as it applies to a Subject. On the page you will see three drop-down lists: one to
	one to select the Measure Status for the Measure, one to select the Measure Status Detail for the
	Measure, and one to select the Staff Member who completed the Action. As well, there is a text
	box with a calndar control to select the date the Action was done, and a large text are to enter
	notes about the Action as it applies to the Subject. To update any of these items, enter in the
	correct information and click the &quot;Submit&quot; button.
</p>
<p>
	When you change the item in the &quot;Measure Status&quot; drop-down list, the items in the &quot;Measure Status
	Detail&quot; list are changed based on the selected Measure Status. The form cannot be submitted
	unless all of the fields (except the &quot;Notes&quot; field) contain valid values.
